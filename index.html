        <h3>The Fox Theatre</h3>
        <p>
          The Fox Theatre is a performing arts center located at 2211 Woodward
          Avenue in Downtown Detroit, Michigan, near the Grand Circus Park
          Historic District. Opened in 1928 as a flagship movie palace in the
          Fox Theatres chain, it was at over 5,000 seats the largest theater in
          the city. Designed by theater architect C. Howard Crane, it was listed
          on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and was designated
          a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its architecture. The area
          surrounding the Fox is nicknamed Foxtown. The city's major performance
          centers and theatres emanate from the Fox Theatre and Grand Circus
          Park Historic District and continue along Woodward Avenue toward the
          Fisher Theatre in the city's New Center.

        <h3>The Fisher Building</h3>
        <p>
          The Fisher Building is a landmark skyscraper located at 3011 West
          Grand Boulevard in the heart of the New Center area of Detroit,
          Michigan. The ornate 30-story building, completed in 1928, is one of
          the major works of architect Albert Kahn, and is designed in an Art
          Deco style, faced with limestone, granite, and several types of
          marble. The Fisher family financed the building with proceeds from the
          sale of Fisher Body to General Motors. It was designed to house office
          and retail space.
